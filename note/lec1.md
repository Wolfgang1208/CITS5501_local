# Testing types:
    Data-driven testing
        JUint and ..(framework)
    Property-based testing
        Haskell language
    Verification of software properties
        Microkernel
    Model checking


# Methdology
    general methodology for testing software 
        -> new language/system, 
        <- still be able to design and implement an adequate testing and quality assurance plan

# Software quality
- what are some ways that software can be good?
- What ... can be bad?
    - using user profile detials in some way is really bad
# Software "illities"
## Many features that contribute to the success of software besides just it's "correctness":
- Usability
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Reliability/Availability
- Extensibility
- Securitability [sic]
- Portability

# Software faults, Errors & Failures
- Software fault: A static defect in the software
    - is to do with the source code / operate system / configurations
- .. failure: External, incorrect behavior with respect to the **requirements** (or other description of the expected behavior)
    - what the programmer wrote
    - crash can be failure -> should not 
- .. error: An incorrect internal state that is the manifestation of some fault

## What is requirements?
## Kinds of requirement or specification:
- Business needs "Why?"
- Requirements "What?"
- System specifications "How?"
