# Testing types:
    Data-driven testing
        JUint and ..(framework)
    Property-based testing
        Haskell language
    Verification of software properties
        Microkernel
    Model checking


# Methdology
    general methodology for testing software 
        -> new language/system, 
        <- still be able to design and implement an adequate testing and quality assurance plan

# Software quality
- what are some ways that software can be good?
- What ... can be bad?
    - using user profile detials in some way is really bad
# Software "illities"
## Many features that contribute to the success of software besides just it's "correctness":
- Usability
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Reliability/Availability
- Extensibility
- Securitability [sic]
- Portability

# Software faults, Errors & Failures
- Software fault: A static defect in the software
    - is to do with the source code / operate system / configurations
- .. failure: External, incorrect behavior with respect to the **requirements** (or other description of the expected behavior)
    - what the programmer wrote
    - crash can be failure -> should not 
- .. error: An incorrect internal state that is the manifestation of some fault

## What is requirements?
## Kinds of requirement or specification:
- Business needs "Why?"
- Requirements "What?"
- System specifications "How?" $$$

# Goals of testing
- level 0: There's no difference between testing and debugging (not good)
- level 1: The purpose of testing is to show correctness
- level 2: The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn't work
- level 3: The purpose of testing is not to prove anythong specific, but to reduce the risk of using the software $$$
- level 4: Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop higher quality software
